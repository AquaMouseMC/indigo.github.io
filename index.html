  <div id="para"><p>ID was originally established on November 7th, 2012, and over time, became very popular. However due to a number of factors, _Indigo needed to shut the server down on July 2nd, 2014. It was missed by many, so years later, a number of the original players came together to create a reunion server! AquaMouse officially opened Indigo District 2.0 on February 25th, 2018 to a whitelist-only group, who are all equally as passionate about the old Indigo District as he is. Despite new ownership, the new Indigo District is nearly identical to how the old server was set up, and even includes the previous spawn on the new map! The minigames such as spleef, parkour, mob arena, and 1v1 pits are set up as well! Whether you're an old Indigo District player interested in taking a trip down memory lane, or if you've never heard of Indigo District before and are just looking for a great new server to join, we welcome you to join us today!</br></br></p></div>
